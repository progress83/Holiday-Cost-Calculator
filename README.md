# Holiday-Cost-Calculator
'''
This is a program that calculates a userâ€™s total holiday cost, incluing the cost of plane, hotel, and car-rental.
It allows the user to choose from a list of pre-defined destinations, input the number of nights 
and rental days, and calculates the total cost based on their choices.
